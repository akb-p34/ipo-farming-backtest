# IPO Day Trading Backtest - Comprehensive Audit Framework

## Overview
This audit plan provides a systematic checklist to validate the logic, methodology, and robustness of the IPO day trading backtest system. Each section contains specific items to verify to ensure the backtest produces reliable and realistic results.

---

## 1. Data Integrity Checks ✓

### 1.1 Data Quality
- [ ] **Chronological Ordering**: Verify IPO dates are in chronological order with no future dates
- [ ] **Duplicate Detection**: Check for duplicate ticker symbols and handle appropriately
- [ ] **Price Validation**:
  - [ ] No negative prices
  - [ ] No extreme outliers (e.g., prices > $10,000 or < $0.01)
  - [ ] OHLC consistency (High >= Low, High >= Open/Close, Low <= Open/Close)
- [ ] **Volume Validation**: Ensure volume data is non-negative and realistic
- [ ] **Missing Data Handling**: Document how missing data is handled (skip vs interpolate)

### 1.2 Simulated Data Realism
- [ ] **Opening Pop/Drop**: Verify simulated IPO opening prices follow realistic patterns (typically 0.8x to 1.5x offer price)
- [ ] **Intraday Volatility**: Confirm volatility patterns match real IPO behavior:
  - [ ] Higher volatility in first 15-30 minutes
  - [ ] Moderate volatility mid-day
  - [ ] Increased activity in final 30 minutes
- [ ] **Price Movements**: Check that simulated price changes follow realistic distributions
- [ ] **Mean Reversion**: Verify some tendency toward IPO price throughout the day

---

## 2. Train-Test Split Validation ✓

### 2.1 Split Methodology
- [ ] **70/30 Split by Count**: Confirm split is based on IPO count (not time period)
  - [ ] Training set: First 70% of IPOs chronologically (should be ~4,412 IPOs)
  - [ ] Test set: Remaining 30% of IPOs (should be ~1,891 IPOs)
- [ ] **No Overlap**: Verify zero ticker overlap between train and test sets
- [ ] **Temporal Ordering**: Ensure all training IPOs occur before test IPOs chronologically

### 2.2 Data Leakage Prevention
- [ ] **No Future Information**: Confirm strategy selection uses ONLY training data
- [ ] **Window Selection**: Verify optimal window is chosen based solely on training performance
- [ ] **Parameter Tuning**: Ensure all parameters are optimized on training set only
- [ ] **Test Set Isolation**: Confirm test set is only used for final validation

---

## 3. Strategy Logic Verification ✓

### 3.1 Entry/Exit Execution
- [ ] **Time Precision**: Verify buy/sell times are executed exactly at specified 30-minute intervals
- [ ] **Price Selection**: Confirm using closing price at each time interval
- [ ] **Same-Day Trading**: Ensure all trades enter and exit on IPO day
- [ ] **Market Hours**: Verify all trades occur within 9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET

### 3.2 Position Sizing
- [ ] **2% Risk Rule**: Verify position size = min(portfolio_value * 0.02, portfolio_value / 10)
- [ ] **Capital Constraints**: Ensure no trade exceeds available capital
- [ ] **Consistent Application**: Confirm position sizing is applied uniformly across all trades

### 3.3 Transaction Costs
- [ ] **Commission Modeling**: Document if commissions are included (if not, note as limitation)
- [ ] **Slippage Assumptions**: Document slippage assumptions (if any)
- [ ] **Bid-Ask Spread**: Note if spread costs are modeled

---

## 4. Statistical Robustness ✓

### 4.1 Significance Testing
- [ ] **T-Test Implementation**: Verify t-test is correctly applied to test returns
- [ ] **Null Hypothesis**: Confirm testing against H0: mean return = 0
- [ ] **P-Value Interpretation**: Check p-value < 0.05 for 95% confidence
- [ ] **Sample Size**: Ensure sufficient trades for statistical validity (n > 30)

### 4.2 Performance Metrics
- [ ] **Sharpe Ratio**: Verify calculation uses annualized returns and volatility
  - Formula: (mean_return / std_return) * sqrt(252)
- [ ] **Win Rate**: Confirm calculation: (positive_returns / total_returns) * 100
- [ ] **Average Return**: Check using arithmetic mean of individual trade returns

### 4.3 Confidence Intervals
- [ ] **95% CI Calculation**: Verify confidence intervals for key metrics
- [ ] **Bootstrap Validation**: Consider bootstrap resampling for robust CIs

---

## 5. Risk Management Audit ✓

### 5.1 Drawdown Analysis
- [ ] **Max Drawdown Calculation**:
  - [ ] Track cumulative maximum portfolio value
  - [ ] Calculate: (current_value - cummax) / cummax
  - [ ] Report minimum (most negative) value
- [ ] **Drawdown Duration**: Document longest drawdown period
- [ ] **Recovery Time**: Track time to recover from drawdowns

### 5.2 Risk Metrics
- [ ] **Sortino Ratio**: Verify using downside deviation only
- [ ] **Value at Risk (VaR)**: Consider calculating 95% VaR
- [ ] **Concentration Risk**: Check exposure to individual trades

### 5.3 Portfolio Constraints
- [ ] **Maximum Exposure**: Verify portfolio never exceeds 100% invested
- [ ] **Minimum Cash**: Ensure adequate cash for all trades
- [ ] **Leverage**: Confirm no leverage unless explicitly modeled

---

## 6. Benchmark Comparison ✓

### 6.1 S&P 500 Benchmark
- [ ] **Data Source**: Verify using reliable S&P 500 data (SPY ETF)
- [ ] **Time Period Alignment**: Ensure same date range for fair comparison
- [ ] **Dividend Adjustment**: Use adjusted close prices for total return

### 6.2 Fair Comparison
- [ ] **Risk Adjustment**: Compare Sharpe ratios, not just returns
- [ ] **Same Initial Capital**: Start both strategies with $100,000
- [ ] **Trading Costs**: Apply similar cost assumptions to benchmark

---

## 7. Overfitting Checks ✓

### 7.1 Strategy Complexity
- [ ] **Parameter Count**: Document number of optimized parameters (should be minimal)
- [ ] **Window Selection**: Verify not cherry-picking best historical window
- [ ] **Robustness Test**: Check if nearby windows perform similarly

### 7.2 Out-of-Sample Validation
- [ ] **Performance Degradation**: Document drop in performance from train to test
- [ ] **Acceptable Range**: Moderate degradation (< 30%) is expected
- [ ] **Consistency**: Verify strategy characteristics remain similar

---

## 8. Edge Case Handling ✓

### 8.1 Data Edge Cases
- [ ] **Missing Prices**: Handle IPOs with incomplete intraday data
- [ ] **Halted Trading**: Account for trading halts on IPO day
- [ ] **Late Opens**: Handle IPOs that don't open at 9:30 AM

### 8.2 Calculation Edge Cases
- [ ] **Division by Zero**: Check Sharpe ratio when std = 0
- [ ] **Empty Windows**: Handle windows with no valid trades
- [ ] **Extreme Returns**: Cap unrealistic returns (e.g., > 1000%)

---

## 9. Reproducibility ✓

### 9.1 Random Seed Management
- [ ] **Seed Setting**: Verify random seed is set for simulated data
- [ ] **Reproducible Results**: Confirm same seed produces identical results
- [ ] **Documentation**: Document all random seed values used

### 9.2 Version Control
- [ ] **Code Versioning**: Track code changes via Git
- [ ] **Data Versioning**: Document data sources and versions
- [ ] **Dependency Management**: List all package versions in requirements.txt

---

## 10. Reporting Accuracy ✓

### 10.1 Metric Calculations
- [ ] **CAGR Formula**: ((final_value / initial_value) ^ (1/years)) - 1
- [ ] **Total Return**: (final_value - initial_value) / initial_value
- [ ] **Trade Count**: Verify accurate count of executed trades

### 10.2 Visualization Integrity
- [ ] **Axis Scaling**: Ensure appropriate scales (not misleading)
- [ ] **Data Points**: Verify all data points are accurately plotted
- [ ] **Labels**: Check all charts are properly labeled

## Critical Questions to Answer

1. **Is the backtest realistic?** Would these trades be executable in real markets?
2. **Is the strategy robust?** Does it work across different time periods and market conditions?
3. **Is there selection bias?** Are we cherry-picking favorable IPOs or time periods?
4. **Is the risk acceptable?** Is the drawdown and volatility within reasonable limits?
5. **Is it statistically significant?** Are results better than random chance?
6. **Would it survive real trading?** Account for costs, slippage, and market impact?
